# ASURA ARDUINO CODE

This project is already archived (2017) and has not been finalized, however, it is maintained on Github (and I am creating a README) due to nostalgia =)

The purpose of this code was to be the hardware part of Asura Glass (an old project of mine, which was not forward, which was intended to be a smartglass that could allow the download of applications programmed in .JS).

`ArduinoCode.ino` is the old code, which was very complex. `NewArduinoCode.ino` is the" most current "code (although it is still old), more simplified, but not so complete.
